## YouMatter
A simple, peer-to-peer support hotline to help all of us feel better. I was inspired to make this application during the hackBCA which overlapped into Valentines Day.

## No One is Left Alone
Valentines Day is a beautiful day to spend with your loved ones, however sometimes, some people may not have anyone to spend it with or even talk to. This application is designed to provide support for those around us and give back to the community by having the ability to register in the database as "operators". 

## Operators receive Calls to their Phones
Operators can schedule their available hours and have calls redirected to them from the hotline during that time. 
When calls are redirected to operators, they will have text messages sent to them to notify them that they are important.
Everyone who calls should walk away, knowing that they do matter.
